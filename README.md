# DiegoG Utilities
Merely a set of shared projects and (If I update them) assemblies that offer several classes useful in a variety of situations.

Some of the code featured here may have been taken from snippets, and other sources that claim the code to be usable for free. All of the classes defined here can be used by anyone and anything that wishes to use them, for free, and without the need to credit me.

Pull requests are welcome
